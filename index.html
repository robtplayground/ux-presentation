				<h1>What's the problem?</h1>
				<p>Goals? Needs? What is not being met?</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>Business Problem</h1>

				<p>Reporting workload at PLAYGROUND XYZ is increasing exponentially as client-base is growing fast</p>

				<h1>User problem</h1>

				<p>Our customers are not getting all the info they need, when they need it (on demand, real-time updates)</p>

			</section>

			<section>

				<h1>Business Objectives</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>Facilitate the exponential growth of the company</li>
					<li>Provide world-class end-to-end service</li>
					<li>Close the loop on adding value for advertisers and publishers = accessible data on our formats</li>
					<li>Build trust through transparency</li>
				</ul>

				<aside class="notes">
					<ul>
						<li>Facilitate the growth of the company by reducing the accompanying overhead of reporting on ads and campaigns</li>
						</li>
						<li><strong>Delight users</strong> by providing world-class end-to-end service for their hosted ads and campaigns</li>
						<li><strong>Build great relationships with users</strong> through increased transparency</li>

						<li><strong>Improve in-house insight into the performance or our ad products</strong>, for business improvements and promotional purposes</li>
					</ul>

			<section>
				<h1>What do we need?</h1>
				<h5 style="">
						Create a <strong>time-saving workflow</strong> <br> that enables us to: </h5>

				<ul>
					<li>deliver metrics and analytics to PLAYGROUND XYZ customers about their ads and campaigns.</li>
					<li>deliver high-level insights to Publishers about ads and campaigns running on their sites</li>
					<li>access and generate required analytics in-house to use for customer support and sales.</li>
				</ul>

				</p>

			</section>


			<section>
				<h1>Success?</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>Scotâ€™s time no longer spent reporting so he can concentrate on company development</li>
					<li>Reporting requests shift to support requests...</li>
					<li>... and support requets reduce overtime.</li>
					<li>Positive feedback from users, testimonials, survey for responses</li>
					<li>Percentage of time spent reporting from COO and Ops Coordinators (currenntly 40% of SCot's time goes on reporting)</li>
				</ul>

				<aside class="notes">
					How do we know we've succeeded? Currently Scot spends 40% of time reporting and new Coordinator will spend 60% of their time doing the same.

				<h1>How do we do this?</h1>

				<img data-src="img/how.png" alt="How brain storming">

				<aside class="notes">
					<p>We don't know yet - need to determine this.</p>
					<p>Have to decide if we have enough information to make that determination yet, and if not how can we get it.</p>
				</aside>

			<section>
				<h1>How do we figure out what to do?</h1>
				<p>Research.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>Research Goals</h1>
				<ol>
					<li>We will clearly identify who the <strong>primary users</strong> are and the context in which they will be using our reporting system.</li>
					<li>We will determine the <strong>key metrics and analytics</strong> required for reporting on PLAYGROUND XYZ ads and campaigns by our various users, in order or priority.</li>
					<li>We will describe the various <strong>user workflows</strong> within which our reporting data is used, to understand how we might best integrate our data reporting into these workflows.</li>
				</ol>

			<section>
				<h1>Research so far</h1>
				<p>Internal Experience + Assumptions</p>
				<p><small>Scot Lidell (+ Rob Hall, Jono Mullins)</small></p>
				<p>User Survey</p>
				<p><small>Small sample, 16 respondents, 90% complete</small></p>

				<h1>Internal Experience + Assumptions</h1>

			<section>
				<h1>Primary users</h1>

				<ul>
					<li>Coordinator, Media Agency</li>
					<li>Commercials Manager, Publisher</li>
				</ul>

			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>Personas</h1>
				<p>Executive alignment strategy with proto-personas - can be based on assumptions and experience, for planning</p>
				<p>Main purpose is team alignment through empathy, but risky if not based in observed facts - innacuracies will flow into all aspects of product development</p>

				<h1>Are we done?</h1>
				<p>Yes, align team with needs of these personas</p>
				<p>No, further research is needed to check our assumptions</p>

				<h1>Survey results</h1>
				<p>Opened the door to engaging our customers/users in our design process (contributing suggestions, feedback, ongoing user testing)</p>

			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>Survey results</h1>
				<p><i class="fa fa-warning"></i> Danger!</p>
				<p>Responses from tiny sample of users</p>
				<p>Responses were rushed and incomplete</p>
				<p>Questions yielded ambiguosly-phrased answers</p>

				<h1>Summary</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>Got a few new ideas from our user-base</li>
					<li>We are still in a design process based on best-guess assumptions, internal experiences. Bit risky.</li>
					<li>Learning what the problems are, but do we know precisely <em>why</em> they occur. We may end up spending time on more complex solutions than  necessary</li>
					<li>Hard to prioritise development priorities with total accuracy</li>
				</ul>

			<section>
				<h1>Where to now?</h1>
				<ol style="opacity: 0.6;">
					<li>We will clearly identify who the <strong>primary users</strong> are and the context in which they will be using our reporting system.</li>
					<li>We will determine the <strong>key metrics and analytics</strong> required for reporting on PLAYGROUND XYZ ads and campaigns by our various users, in order or priority.</li>

				<h1>The good news</h1>
				<p>Anything is probably better than what we are currently doing. Room for lots of wins. </p>

			<section>
				<h1>The risk</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>Missing an important foundational element, create crippling tech debt</li>
